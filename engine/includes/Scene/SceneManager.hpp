	SceneManager is responsible for traversing the
	Scenes folder and compiling pointers to the Scene
	Graph. So each Scene will be created but that Scene's
	Assets will be unloaded. I think the edges of the
	current root node(i.e. the current Scene), should be
	partially or full initialized, depending on memory
	constraints.

	Perhaps the developer will provide hints to dynamically
	preload these Scenes for smoother transitions and shorter
	buffer time
