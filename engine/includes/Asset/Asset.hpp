class Asset {
/*
Each asset type inherits from this base Asset
class. When loaded, each Asset will have to
read flags in the file to determine what
type of Asset file it is, what files it
will be acquiring (textures, audio, etc.)
and what file types those files are encoded in.

Then it will overload some generic functions here
and this will produce a pointer to be given back to
the Scene that owns this asset
