![What we got so far!](https://imgur.com/hFDuzqr)

need to sync with dev rendering

 - [ ] need to automate/test dep curl & install
 - [ ] need to write a test program that just uses the engine lib instead of just compiling bin

# Boost
## concurrency and data structures

# Vulkan 1.1.92.1
## rendering
curl from website

# GLFW
just install the submodule

# TOBJ Loader and STB
come prepackaged
